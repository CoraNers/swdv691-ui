# Let's Multiply! (UI)

## Purpose
The purpose of Let's Multiply! is to help students with their multiplication.  They are able to practice all the multiplication facts, they can be evaulated (timed) to see their scores improve, and they can view a history of all facts they've answered, to show them or their parent what facts may need some additional practice.  Learning through gaming!

Students will be able to log into the application and choose what category they want to play.  In practice mode, for each question, they'll be visually told whether their answer was correct or incorrect, and what the correct answer is.  In evaluation mode, each set of questions will be timed in the background and shown to the student when they've completed a category.  

Keeping historical data for each logged-in student can show the student, parent, teacher, or tutor trends in their learning to help them master multiplication for good.
